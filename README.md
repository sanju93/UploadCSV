I need to upload the csv files and show thier data

Firstly, I was create the form to upload the file and i need a library to convert the csv file into the json so, i used a library that is (csvtojson) so it can convert the csv file into the json data after that i was show the file name in the home page when the user will click on that file name so that the file will open in the another page and show thier data.


I have used the functionality like searching,pagination,upload only csv files these functionality i've done using the simple javascript

required libarary is ejs,express,mongoose and csvtojson
